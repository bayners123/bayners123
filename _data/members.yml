#           My name is Charles. I like designing websites and shining lasers on things.
#           This _is not_ a line break. On the website, this line and the previous one
#           will be joined together. However, the next line will be seperated
#           by a line break:  
#           
#           That's because the line before this one ended with two spaces: "  " then a blank line.

              Charles has been described by some people as an "honorary" member of the group.
              This means that he hangs around while the rest of the group is drinking often enough
              that they have come to accept him.

              Gaby is from Mexico and completed an undergraduate course at Universidad de las AmÃ©ricas,
              Puebla. She is in the third year of her D.Phil. She is researching the reactivity of group
              14 & 15 Zintl anions towards organometallic complexes. She enjoys playing drums, capoeira
              and sculpting marble figures of legendary Mexican singers in her free time. 
    - name: Jose

              Jose carried out his undergraduate degree at the University of Zaragoza in his home country
              of Spain. After a brief stint as an Erasmus student at the University of Cambridge with
              Professor Paul Raithby, he began his Ph.D work at the University of Bath under the supervision
              of Mike Whittlesey. He completed his thesis in 2003 on the synthesis and reactivity of novel
              water-soluble ruthenium (II) phosphine complexes. A postdoctoral position with Professor Slavi
              Sevov at the University of Notre Dame followed (2003-2006) exploring the reactivity of anionic
              deltahedral Zintl ions in solution.  
              
              Jose was appointed to a University Lectureship in Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Oxford
              on October 1st 2006.

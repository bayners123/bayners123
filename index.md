# Welcome to the Goicoechea Group website!


Research in the Goicoechea Group is focused on the chemistry of highly reductive main-group and transition metal clusters and organometallic complexes.  We are particularly interested in exploratory chemical synthesis with the aim of synthesising new and exciting compounds and solids.  Have a look round our website and see what we are all about.

More information on current research projects, published work, current and former group members and opportunities within the group can be found by following the links above.

title: Main group and transition metal cluster chemistry
---


Recent years have witnessed a renaissance of main-group cluster chemistry as the solution-phase reactivity of the "naked" polyanions of groups 14 and 15 has been explored.[1,2] The use of transition metal reagents (particularly open-shell species) has resulted in the isolation of a series of novel species in which the metal atoms play an essential role in the stabilization of large, otherwise unattainable geometries.[3,4] Figure 1 shows two such clusters. The remarkable pentagonal prismatic geometry exhibited by [Fe@Ge<sub>10</sub>]<sup>3–</sup> makes it the first species of its kind to be isolated.[3] Furthermore, the structure of [Ru@Ge<sub>12</sub>]<sup>3–</sup> contrasts dramatically with the known deltahedral or approximately deltahedral geometries of [M@Pb<sub>12</sub>]<sup>2–</sup> (M = Ni, Pd, Pt) and [Mn@Pb<sub>12</sub>]<sup>3–</sup> and is a result of extensive delocalization of electron density from the transition-metal centre onto the cage.[4]

In addition to the activation chemistry of the clusters, simple salt metathesis of metal halides has yielded a range of coordination compounds bearing intact Zintl clusters. For example, reaction of FeCl<sub>2</sub> with K<sub>3</sub>P<sub>7</sub> in the presence of a proton source affords an iron centre sandwiched by two protonated heptaphosphide cages, which can be viewed as a Zintl analogue of ferrocene (see Figure 2).[5] There are multiple different binding modes for both group 14 and 15 clusters, which can be pre-ordained by a judicious choice of metal centre, and these give rise to a multitude of products that can be further functionalised.

The ability of Zintl ions to undergo nucleophilic and electrophilic substitution allows for their integration into cluster-assembled materials. The clusters isolated to date represent the first steps in a nascent area of chemistry where many interesting breakthroughs await.

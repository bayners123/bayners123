Applications to join our team are always extremely welcome. We are always excited to hear from talented and enthusiastic Part II, DPhil and postdoctoral candidates. Please contact Jose directly by phone, fax or email if you would like further information.


###  Part II Studentships

Jose Goicoechea supervises four Part II students each year. These projects involve a wide range of topics and generally include the synthesis and characterisation of new inorganic compounds. Contact Jose by email to discuss available research areas.

###  D.Phil Studentships

Studentships are typically advertised on the departmental webpage. Applications from overseas PhD candidates are very welcome. These applicants generally need to secure scholarships to fund their studies in Oxford. Information on Graduate Admissions, Studentships and sources of funding can be found in the Oxford University Graduate Prospectus, which is on-line [here](http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/gsp/).

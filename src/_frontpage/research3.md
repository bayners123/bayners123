The isolobal relationship between a methine moiety (C–H) and a phosphorus atom allows for the synthesis of interesting phosphorus-containing variants of organic molecules. This has led to phosphorus being referred to as the “carbon-copy”. Following on from the successful transition metal-mediated activation of [E<sub>7</sub>]<sup>3–</sup> (E = P, As),[1,2] we were prompted to explore the activation of [P<sub>7</sub>]<sup>3–</sup> using unsaturated organic fragments. This led to the synthesis of a range of 1,2,3-triphospholides (and their heavier arsenic congeners), which are related to the ubiquitous cyclopentadienyl ligand.[3–5] 

We have also reported the activation of [P<sub>7</sub>]<sup>3–</sup> by ambient pressures of carbon monoxide to form the phosphaethynolate anion, PCO<sup>–</sup>, as the [K(18-crown-6)]+ salt.[6] This has opened an exciting new avenue of research in the group, as at the time of publication there were few reports in the chemical literature on this heavier congener of the omnipresent cyanate anion, NCO<sup>–</sup>. We have since reported the cycloaddition chemistry of PCO<sup>–</sup> towards heteroallenes to form phosphorus-containing heterocycles,[6] and its reactivity towards strained main group systems.[7] 

Furthermore, by analogy with Wöhler’s paradigm-shifting synthesis of urea in 1828, the reaction of PCO<sup>–</sup> with ammonium salts was found to yield the unprecedented phosphinecarboxamide.[8] This inorganic analogue of urea is a rare example of an air-stable primary phosphine, and its ligand properties have been explored.[9] We believe these molecules are of fundamental interest and harbour enormous potential as building blocks for organophosphorus reagents and phosphorus-containing polymers. Work on this topic is currently on-going.

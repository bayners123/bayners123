The primary structural characterisation technique we use is single crystal X-ray diffraction. This technique allows us to determine the chemical structure of reaction products. The CRL basement houses two Enraf-Nonius single crystal diffractometers, both of which are fitted with low temperature nitrogen cryostreams, allowing for the collection of data from air sensitive samples at a range of temperatures.

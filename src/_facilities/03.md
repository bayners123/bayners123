Weighing of air-sensitive reagents and products is routinely carried out in the group's glove-box which has a computer controlled nitrogen atmosphere. Both water and oxygen levels are maintained below 0.1 ppm. The glove-box also contains dehydrated solvents which permits small scale, sensitive reactions to be carried out overnight, within the glove-box itself.

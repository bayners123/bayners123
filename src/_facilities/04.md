Zintl phase starting materials such as K<sub>4</sub>Ge<sub>9</sub> or Na<sub>3</sub>As<sub>7</sub> are directly synthesised by the combination of elements in sealed niobium tubes that are heated in a high temperature furnace for several days. The tubes are sealed in the absence of oxygen using a custom built arc-welder with a chamber that can be evacuated and filled with argon. Niobium is used to avoid side reactions taking place with the metal vessel at the high temperatures. The tubes are placed in larger silica glass ampoules which are evacuated before sealing with a glass blowing torch.

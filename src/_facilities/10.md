Powder X-ray diffraction is frequently used to confirm that bulk samples have the same structure as single crystals. The Department of Chemistry houses several powder X-ray instruments including three Siemens D5000 high-resolution X-ray powder diffractometers and two PANalytical X'Pert Pro diffractometers. The Siemens D5000 shown to the left is particularly well suited for air sensitive samples which can be flame sealed under nitrogen in capillary tubes.

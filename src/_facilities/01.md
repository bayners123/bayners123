The Goicoechea Group is based in lab S11 the Chemistry Research Laboratory and benefits from the state of the art facilities the building has to offer. In addition, we have access to resources available in the Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory building and in other departments within the University of Oxford. These slides provide a flavour of the frequently used group and communal resources.

Many of the materials that the group works with are highly air- and moisture-sensitive, requiring special equipment to manipulate them in order to avoid contact with the air. All of the laboratory fume hoods are fitted with dual manifold Schlenk lines so that attached vessels can be purged of air and water prior to their contact with reagents.

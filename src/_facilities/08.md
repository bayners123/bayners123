Mass spectroscopy enables us to determine the molecular mass and isotope distribution patterns of metal clusters in solution. This is a very powerful tool as each cluster will have an accurately predictable pattern which acts as a fingerprint to confirm its presence in solution. The group predominantly uses negative and positive ion-mode electrospray mass spectroscopy as a characterisation tool, employing one of the two instruments located in the CRL basement.

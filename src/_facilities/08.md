Solid-state crystallographic data is frequently supported by solution techniques such as NMR and mass-spectrometry. There are two 300 MHz NMR spectrometers available on the 2nd floor of the CRL, one of which is equipped with an automated sample submission system. The automated instrument provides routine proton, carbon, phosphorous and fluorine NMR. The second instrument is frequently used for less common NMR active nuclei such as boron or lead, or for variable temperature experiments or experiments that require prolonged data collection times.

      desc: >
              Gaby is from Mexico and completed an undergraduate course at Universidad de las Américas,
              Puebla. She is in the third year of her D.Phil. She is researching the reactivity of group
              14 & 15  Zintl anions towards organometallic complexes. She enjoys playing drums, capoeira
              and sculpting marble figures of legendary Mexican singers in her free time.

    - name: Andy Jupp
      desc: Andy is a second year D.Phil. student researching phosphorus-containing molecules derived from group 15 Zintl clusters, particularly that of the PCO anion. Having survived his Part II year in the group he now enjoys (mostly) no longer being the one asking the most stupid questions in the lab. Outside of the lab Andy has no extracurricular activities and despite having kissed the Blarney Stone has absolutely no chat either.

    - name: Mike Geeson
      desc: Mike is a Part II student from Merton College, carrying out a joint research project with Professor John McGrady. He is computationally investigating the recently synthesised phosphinecarboxamide and some related structures. When not sat in front of a computer, Mike spends his time playing squash and rugby - or persuading the group to let him loose in the lab.

    - name: Rob Turbervill
      desc: Rob is an EPSRC funded Doctoral Prize holder. He has worked in most of the group's research areas during either his Part II or DPhil studies. His current research is focused on extending his DPhil work on the the reactivity of group 15 cluster anions towards unsaturated organic substrates. He enjoys hiking, running, and taking a curious interest in the affairs of the New Orleans Saints.

    - name: Dave Gillott
      desc: Dave is a Part II student from St John's and is currently investigating unsaturated group 15 ring systems. Dave prides himself in not having an inside voice and so can be heard even if you're not in the CRL with him. He enjoys tennis, football, Sul Ki Do and parkour, and would much prefer to be doing sport than drinking. Many would argue Dave doesn't understand how to be a student.

    - name: Jose Goicoechea
      desc: >
              Jose carried out his undergraduate degree at the University of Zaragoza in his home country
              of Spain. After a brief stint as an Erasmus student at the University of Cambridge with
              Professor Paul Raithby, he began his Ph.D work at the University of Bath under the
              supervision of Mike Whittlesey. He completed his thesis in 2003 on the synthesis and
              reactivity of novel water-soluble ruthenium (II) phosphine complexes. A postdoctoral
              position with Professor Slavi Sevov at the University of Notre Dame followed (2003-2006)
              exploring the reactivity of anionic deltahedral Zintl ions in solution. 
              
              Jose was appointed to a University Lectureship in Inorganic Chemistry at the University of
              Oxford on October 1st 2006.

    - name: Tom Robinson
      desc: Tom is the postdoctoral researcher within the group. He completed his postgraduate studies at the University of Bath working with Prof. Paul Raithby and Dr Andrew Johnson developing novel heterometallic polyyne complexes. When not in the Lab he’s usually travelling to or from the Lab and can commonly be seen shouting expletives at the electronic notice board at Oxford station. Outside the tyranny of train travel he’s often chasing wildlife around the countryside with his camera or making cakes to test on the group.

    - name: Jordan Waters
      desc: Jordan, now a first year D.Phil. student in the group after having completed his Part II in the group last year, is continuing research on N-heterocyclic carbenes and dicarbenes, however we’re not so sure as he spends most of his time at his desk rather than in the lab. He claims he likes to bake, play guitar and go cycling but probably will be found in the pub instead.

    - name: Izzy Paterson-Taylor
      desc: Izzy is a Part II student from New College, researching the activation of group 15 Zintl ions under the supervision of Gaby. When not in the lab, she can generally be found at the ice rink until the small hours of the morning, training for the only acceptable sort of hockey. Izzy also enjoys playing the violin and flute, as well as eating large amounts of food.

    - name: Jack Duckworth
      desc: Jack is a Part II from New, doing a joint project with John McGrady. Little is known about his identifying characteristics, because he seems to enjoy spending his time in the dank, dark depths of the ICL dungeon more than in the sunny climes of S11 in the CRL.

    - name: Caroline Knapp
      desc: Caroline, a fourth year D.Phil researcher, is from Corpus Christi College and is working with Group 15 Zintl ions, continuing from her Part II project with this group.

    - name: Phil McCullough
      desc: Phil - who has an alter-ego called Brian - is a Part II from St Catherine's. He is working on investigating the reactivity of group 15 Zintl ions with unsaturated compounds under Rob's eagle eye. If nobody else is looking, he likes to break as much glassware as he can. When he is not at the lab or the river, he enjoys cooking, obscure Radio 4 programs, and having drunken arguments with Park End DJs who refuse to play Glee songs.

    - name: Becca Musgrave
      desc: Becca, affectionately known as Muzzlechops, is a Part II from Oriel and is keenly researching low valent organometallic compounds under Mark's exacting yet precise supervision. When not in labs, which does seem to be most of the time, she can be found miming in the college choir, getting messy with other women on a rugby pitch or increasing her vast collection of vintage (pimp) coats.

    - name: Mark Irwin
      desc: Mark is from Oriel College and previously completed a Part II with the group. He is now a fourth year D.Phil researcher and enjoys the increased power and potential for corruption this affords him. He is an avid fan of mountain biking, endurance nocturnal mole watching, photography and sport spectating. Preferably from a sofa. He is researching highly reduced organic systems and is also meant to be responsible for this website.

    - name: Melissa Raybould
      desc: Melissa is a Part II from LMH, doing a joint project with the McGrady Bunch. Nobody knows why she spends most of her time locked in the ICL basement, but we reckon it is because she finds opening doors inherently difficult. At least it stops her melting more expensive equipment. Keen to waste more people's money, she then pulls freshers dodgy pints in the college bar. In her free time, she enjoys dancing, rowing (just for the crew dates), and shark taxonomy.

Her recent hero is Eduard Zintl and her talents include forgetting to turn on Argon gas and testing solvent effects with her face. Outside of the lab, she enjoys road cycling and having dinner parties, when not accidentally spending weekends in the pub after meaning to go for a cheeky pint.

    - name: Charlie Webb
      desc: Charlie recently joined the group as a part II, and is the key member of Team Zintl. This year he has the pleasure of working on Zintl ion complexes of the lanthanides, Actinides and group 10 transition metals. In his spare time he is preparing to take on the beer mat flipping world record having secured funding from Jose. So far he has successfully flipped 23 beer mats, his aim is to achieve 50 by the end of this year. Charlie also enjoys playing squash, lacrosse and having a good night out with friends.

    - name: MarkD Denning
      desc: Mark completed a D.Phil on the intercalation chemistry of fullerenes under the supervision of Professor M. J. Rosseinsky. Outside interests include cricket, swimming, running, ice skating and amateur dramatics.

    - name: Belinda Hichins
      desc: Belinda's work is largely split into two categories, the first covers her childhood fascination with the reactions and compounds of bipyridine. The second area is concerned with human behaviour under stress, specifically the addition of air to the glovebox and its effect on the group.

    - name: Joe Large
      desc: Joe, a Part II from Worcester, is supposed to be working on a project involving Group 15 Zintl ions but instead is embarking on a mission to break the entire lab’s glassware. Outside of the lab you’ll probably find him playing cricket or occasionally playing football (for which he has gained a violent reputation), while also being keen to watch any sort of sport on TV.

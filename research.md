Research
========

Current research in the Goicoechea group is centred on the _solution reactivity of chemical systems in highly-reductive media_. Encompassed under this banner are: a) studies on the chemistry of anionic Zintl ions, b) the study of metals in negative oxidation states (Au<sup>−</sup>, Pt<sup>2−</sup>), and c) fundamental research into the electronic and molecular structures of chemically-reduced heterocyclic systems. The main focus of such studies is the synthesis of novel compounds which pose fundamental questions on chemical bonding. Ultimately, we aim to develop new models with which to rationalize bonding in high-nuclearity cluster systems. Many of the species we are currently investigating may be employed as _synthons_ towards the isolation of metal nanoparticles, mesostructured solids and MOFs, areas into which we aim to expand in the near future.


Solution reactivity of deltahedral Zintl ions

The reactivity of group 14 and 15 Zintl anions in solution has witnessed somewhat of a renaissance in recent years.<sup>1</sup> However, despite many new developments, a wide range of fundamental investigative research remains to be carried out. Recently, we and others have demonstrated that the reductive M-C bond activation of post-transition metal organometallic reagents such as M(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (M = Zn, Cd, Hg) and Cu<sub>5</sub>(Mes)<sub>5</sub> (Mes = 2, 4, 6-Me<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>) can give rise to a variety of novel functionalized, endohedral or oligomeric Zintl anions (Figure 1).<sup>2-7</sup> These studies have yielded a versatile route towards controlled cluster functionalisation which may be employed in the near future to build-up more complex supramolecular systems. 

More recently, we have extended such studies to mid-row transition-metals as well, yielding the unprecedented Zintl ion [Fe@Ge<sub>10</sub>]<sup>3−</sup> (Figure 2).<sup>8</sup> The remarkable pentagonal prismatic geometry exhibited by this cluster anion makes it the first species of its kind to be isolated. Moreover, chemical bonding within such a species cannot be rationalized employing conventional models for bonding in metal clusters. This finding demonstrates that we have yet to fully understand the reactivity of Zintl cluster anions and that many exciting new species are still available which will test our abilities to comprehend their relative stability.
Among the exploratory synthetic experiments we are currently investigating are reactivity studies of [E<sup>IV</sup>]<sup>_x_−</sup> clusters (E<sup>IV</sup> = Si, Ge, Sn, Pb; _x_ = 2-4) towards an array of low valent organometallic reagents and transition metal compounds. From the preliminary work carried out to date, we envision that a wide breadth of novel mixed-metal clusters will become available as a result of this research. Oxidation of group 15 Zintl ions also offers a viable synthetic route towards nanometric clusters and materials. We are particularly interested in clusters of III-V semiconducting alloys such as GaAs which are available _via_ the oxidation of E<sup>V</sup><sub>7</sub><sup>3−</sup> (E<sup>V</sup> = P, As, Sb) with E<sup>III</sup>Ph<sub>3</sub> (E<sup>III</sup> = Al, Ga, In, Tl).

Large molecular clusters of nanometric proportions pose many fundamental questions on the nature of chemical bonding. Interstitial metal atoms are known to stabilise otherwise unstable geometries from within, yet valence electron counts for such species often fail to obey established rules for bonding in molecules. New theories analyzing these differences need to be developed particularly as cluster size increases and deviations away from spherical geometries are encountered. One of the great advantages of developing a ‘bottom-up’ approach to nanoparticles and extended solids is that the insights gained in the study of molecular systems, which have a well-established chemical composition, may be extrapolated to larger nanoparticle-like systems where the exact chemical composition of the species being studied may not necessarily be known.

Reactivity studies of Au<sup>−</sup>, and Ag<sup>−</sup> and Pt<sup>2−</sup> solutions
------------

Bimetallic alloys of the alkali metals with gold, silver or platinum offer discrete anionic species in the solid state and/or in solution.<sup>9</sup> The gold and silver phases are known to be soluble in liquid ammonia yet to date their solution reactivity remains dormant, perhaps due to the highly reduced nature of such species and the subsequent difficulties associated with their manipulation. Controlled oxidation of these anionic species by positively-charged metal reagents in the presence of strongly coordinating ligands offers a unique synthetic route towards the isolation of precious metal cluster systems, an area we have recently begun to investigate. The products of such reactions should exhibit a central metallic core stabilized by naked main-group elements or metal-ligand shells. Modification of reaction conditions and ligating agents offers the possibility of manipulating cluster size and composition and, as a result, the physical and chemical properties associated with such systems.

Highly-reduced heterocyclic organic radicals and multiply-charged anions
----------------

The focus of this research is the synthesis and characterisation of novel coordination polymers based on the 4, 4'-bipyridyl radical, the 4, 4’-bipyridyl dianion and related highly-reduced pyridyl-based anionic spacers. The negative charge associated with these species will allow for the synthesis of unprecedented materials otherwise unattainable through use of neutral linkers. Repulsive electrostatic interactions between spacers should reduce the likelihood of synthesising interpenetrated networks, allowing for the isolation of porous solids with potential molecular storage capabilities. Furthermore, the electrons present on anionic spacers will generate interesting conductive materials and/or species with strong magnetic communication between unpaired electrons. The systematic variation of spacers and nodes will allow us to build up a library of novel solids from which to extract interesting correlations between the solid-state structures and physical properties of these anion-based materials. 
Preliminary studies carried out by our research group have yielded a route towards the synthesis of bulk quantities of the 4, 4’-bipyridyl radical anion and the unprecedented dianion in high yields (Figure 3).<sup>10</sup> We have characterised these species by single crystal X-ray diffraction in Na(en)(44BPY<sup>&bull;−</sup>) and Na<sub>2</sub>(44BPY<sup>2−</sup>)(en)<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Very recently, we have further extended these studies to include the radical and dianionic forms of additional isomers of bipyridine: 2, 2’ and 2, 4’.<sup>11</sup> These studies have yielded organic molecules which are ‘stable’ in three different oxidation states, a property which may become useful for data storage at a molecular level. From a coordination chemistry viewpoint the 4, 4’-bipyridyl radical and dianion represent a unique postern towards the synthesis of novel coordination polymers of metal cations interconnected by bridging anionic linkers. Furthermore, many additional spacers based on related heterocyclic systems such as 2,7-diazapyrene or 3,8-diazaphenanthroline should become available in due course.
